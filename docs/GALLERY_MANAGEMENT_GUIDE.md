# How to Manage the Animation Gallery

Your gallery page is live at **`/gallery`**. This guide explains how to maintain and evolve it as a canonical operating reference.

## What Was Built

1. **Gallery page** (`app/gallery/page.tsx`) – Motion Array–style layout with:
   - Dark hero section
   - Left sidebar filters (category, tags, sort)
   - Search bar
   - 4-column responsive grid
   - Modal with live animation on card click

2. **Gallery modal** (`components/gallery/GalleryModal.tsx`) – Renders the actual animation component (no duplication)

3. **Data source** – Reuses `ANIMATION_REGISTRY` from `src/data/animations.ts` (no new data file)

4. **GitHub URLs** – Add mappings in `lib/galleryGithubMap.ts` when you have repo links

## Post-Generation Checklist

### Step 1: Review the Component List

Cursor will show you something like:

```typescript
// galleryAnimations.ts
export const animations = [
  {
    id: 'lifecycle-engine',
    title: 'Lifecycle Engine Dashboard',
    description: 'Auto-generated description...',
    category: 'Analytics',
    tags: ['Lifecycle', 'Retention'],
    githubUrl: '', // You'll add these
    componentPath: '@/components/dashboards/LifecycleEngine',
  },
  // ... 49 more
];
```

**Your job:**
- ✅ Verify titles are correct
- ✅ Improve descriptions if needed
- ✅ Check categories are accurate
- ✅ Add GitHub URLs
- ✅ Add/adjust tags

### Step 2: Add GitHub URLs

Create a simple mapping file or spreadsheet:

```txt
lifecycle-engine → https://github.com/youruser/lifecycle-engine
marketing-flow → https://github.com/youruser/marketing-flow
conversion-funnel → https://github.com/youruser/conversion-funnel
...
```

Then tell Cursor:
```
Update galleryAnimations.ts with these GitHub URLs:
[paste your list]
```

### Step 3: Generate Thumbnails

You have 3 options:

#### Option A: Use Component Screenshots
```
Create a script that:
1. Renders each component at 800x480
2. Takes a screenshot using Puppeteer
3. Saves to /public/gallery-thumbnails/
4. Names files matching animation IDs
5. Updates galleryAnimations.ts with paths
```

#### Option B: Manual Screenshots
```bash
# For each animation:
1. Visit the page where it's used
2. Take screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac)
3. Crop to 800x480px
4. Save as /public/gallery-thumbnails/animation-id.png
```

#### Option C: Placeholder Images (temporary)
Cursor can generate nice gradient placeholders initially.

### Step 4: Test the Gallery

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Visit the gallery page
# http://localhost:3000/gallery (or your port)

# Test:
✓ All cards render
✓ Filters work
✓ Search works (if added)
✓ Clicking cards opens modal
✓ Animations load and run in modal
✓ GitHub links work
✓ Mobile responsive
✓ No console errors
```

## Adding New Animations

When you create a new animation:

1. **Build the component** (as you normally do)
2. **Update galleryAnimations.ts**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'new-animation',
  title: 'New Animation Name',
  description: 'What it does...',
  category: 'Analytics',
  tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2'],
  githubUrl: 'https://github.com/user/new-animation',
  componentPath: '@/components/NewAnimation',
  thumbnailPath: '/gallery-thumbnails/new-animation.png',
}
```
3. **Generate thumbnail** (screenshot or script)
4. **Done!** It appears in the gallery automatically

## Customizing Descriptions

Tell Cursor to improve descriptions:

```
Review all animation descriptions in galleryAnimations.ts.
Make them more compelling for hiring managers:
- Start with the business value
- Mention key technical features
- Keep under 2 sentences
- Make them exciting but professional

Example:
Before: "Dashboard with charts showing email metrics"
After: "Real-time email campaign analytics with predictive 
send-time optimization, A/B test tracking, and engagement 
heatmaps for maximizing subscriber conversion."

Rewrite all descriptions.
```

## Category Management

### Current Categories
Cursor will suggest categories based on what it finds.

### Adding New Categories
```typescript
// In galleryAnimations.ts
export const categories = [
  'All',
  'Analytics',
  'Campaign Management',
  'Email Marketing',
  'Social Media',
  'Lead Generation', // Add new ones here
  'Content Marketing',
  'SEO',
];
```

### Bulk Recategorize
```
Move all animations with 'email' in the title or tags 
to the 'Email Marketing' category
```

## Tag Management

### Generating Better Tags

```
Analyze all animations and suggest better tags.
Tags should be:
- Searchable (what would users search for?)
- Specific (not just "dashboard")
- Action-oriented ("Real-time", "Predictive", "Interactive")
- Industry-relevant ("Attribution", "Retention", "Conversion")

Update galleryAnimations.ts with improved tags.
```

### Tag Consistency
```
Review all tags across animations and:
1. Standardize similar tags (e.g., "Real-time" vs "Realtime")
2. Remove duplicate/overlapping tags
3. Ensure 3-5 tags per animation
4. Order by relevance
```

## Analytics & Insights

Add tracking to see what's popular:

```
Add view tracking to the gallery:
1. Track when users open a modal
2. Track GitHub link clicks
3. Track most viewed animations
4. Store in localStorage or send to analytics

Show "Popular" or "Trending" badges on top animations.
```

## Advanced Features

### Feature 1: Related Animations
```
In the modal, show 3 "Related Animations" based on:
- Same category
- Similar tags
- Same tech stack

Display as small cards below the main content.
```

### Feature 2: "New" Badges
```
Add a "New" badge to animations added in the last 30 days.
Use the created date from Git commits or manual field.
```

### Feature 3: Search Enhancement
```
Improve search to also search by:
- Tech stack
- Tags
- Description keywords

Highlight matching text in results.
```

### Feature 4: Collections
```
Allow me to create "collections" (featured, favorites, etc.)
Show these as tabs or separate pages.
```

### Feature 5: Direct Links
```
Make each animation card shareable:
- URL like /gallery?animation=lifecycle-engine
- Opens directly to that animation's modal
- Good for sharing specific animations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Animation Won't Load in Modal
```
Check:
1. Import path is correct in galleryAnimations.ts
2. Component exports a default export
3. Component doesn't require specific props
4. No circular dependencies
5. Check browser console for errors
```

### Thumbnails Not Showing
```
Verify:
1. Files exist in /public/gallery-thumbnails/
2. Filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Paths in galleryAnimations.ts are correct
4. Files are committed to Git
5. Check browser network tab
```

### Filter Not Working
```
Check:
1. Category names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. All animations have valid category
3. "All" filter is implemented correctly
4. React state is updating
```

## Sharing Your Gallery

### Add to Main Nav
```
Add "Gallery" link to the main navigation menu.
Should be prominent - this showcases your work!
```

### Create Landing Page CTA
```
Add a section to the homepage with:
- "Explore 50+ Dashboard Animations"
- Nice preview of 3-4 featured animations
- Button linking to /gallery
```

### Social Media
```
Generate Open Graph meta tags for sharing:
- Preview image showing gallery grid
- Compelling title and description
- Proper og:type, og:url tags
```

## Deployment

### Before Deploying
```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview

# Check:
✓ All animations load in production
✓ Thumbnails are included in build
✓ No 404 errors
✓ GitHub links work
✓ Performance is good
```

### After Deploying
```bash
# Visit live site
# Test all features
# Share with friends for feedback
# Monitor for errors (Sentry, etc.)
```

## Metrics to Track

Good to know:
- **Most viewed animations** - showcase these more
- **Highest GitHub click-through** - these convert best
- **Search terms used** - improve categorization
- **Drop-off points** - where users leave
- **Mobile vs desktop usage** - optimize accordingly

## Legacy Prompt Consolidation

The previous standalone prompt docs are now consolidated here as historical references:

- `CURSOR_PROMPT_EXISTING_SITE.md`
- `CURSOR_QUICK_PROMPT.md`

Current recommendation: use this guide as the canonical source for gallery build, iteration, and operations prompts.

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Hiring managers mention specific animations from your gallery
- ✅ People ask to use your animations in their projects
- ✅ You get GitHub stars/forks on the repos
- ✅ Recruiters reference "that marketing dashboard gallery"
- ✅ You can quickly show your best work in interviews

---

This gallery is your portfolio highlight reel. Keep it current, polished, and easy to navigate.

> **Note:** `CURSOR_PROMPT_EXISTING_SITE.md` and `CURSOR_QUICK_PROMPT.md` have been consolidated into this canonical document and archived under `docs/archive/2026-03-16/`.
